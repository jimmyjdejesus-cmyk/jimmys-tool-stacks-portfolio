# Quantum Reservoir Computing Demo

Interactive demonstration of research exploring the theoretical connection between reservoir computing, quantum vacuum fluctuations, and quantum gravity.

## Overview

This demo presents a formal academic whitepaper and interactive visualizations exploring the hypothesis that reservoir computing systems may naturally interface with quantum vacuum fluctuations through mechanisms analogous to the Dynamical Casimir Effect.

## Features

### 1. Reservoir Dynamics Simulator
- Real-time 3D visualization of reservoir state evolution
- Interactive controls for reservoir size, input frequency, and coupling strength
- PCA projection of high-dimensional states to 3D space

### 2. Quantum Vacuum Fluctuations
- Animated simulation of virtual particle creation/annihilation
- Dynamical Casimir Effect demonstration with moving mirror
- Energy conservation visualization

### 3. Reservoir-Quantum Interface
- Side-by-side comparison of reservoir and quantum state spaces
- Uncertainty metrics comparing reservoir dynamics to quantum limits
- Real-time state mapping visualization

### 4. Theoretical Framework Diagram
- Interactive Mermaid diagram showing theory connections
- Click-to-expand nodes with mathematical details
- Visual representation of the research hypothesis
