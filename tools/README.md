# Tools

This directory organizes custom tools, utilities, and scripts.

## Structure

Organize tools by category using subdirectories:

```
tools/
├── cli/              # Command-line tools
├── automation/       # Automation scripts
├── dev-tools/        # Development utilities
├── scripts/          # General-purpose scripts
└── configs/          # Configuration files and templates
```
