# Tech Stacks

This directory contains implementations and examples of various technology stacks.

## Structure

Organize tech stacks by type:

```
tech-stacks/
├── frontend/         # Frontend stacks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
├── backend/          # Backend stacks (Node, Django, Rails, etc.)
├── fullstack/        # Full-stack implementations (MERN, MEAN, etc.)
├── mobile/           # Mobile development stacks
├── devops/           # DevOps and infrastructure stacks
└── data/             # Data engineering and analytics stacks
```

## How to Use

1. **Create subdirectories** for each tech stack category
2. **Document the stack** with architecture diagrams and setup instructions
3. **Include starter templates** for quick project initialization
4. **Add configuration files** for reproducible environments

## Stack Documentation Template

Each stack should include:
- Overview and use cases
- Technologies included
- Setup/installation instructions
- Architecture diagram
- Example projects
- Best practices and conventions
