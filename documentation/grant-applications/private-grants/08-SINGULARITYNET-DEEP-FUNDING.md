## Project Information

### **Project Title**
BiasGuard: Decentralized AI Safety Verification for SingularityNET

### **Category**
AI Safety and Ethics

### **Project Summary** (300 words)

We propose to integrate BiasGuard—a 7-layer semantic pipeline for real-time bias and hallucination detection—with the SingularityNET ecosystem. This will provide decentralized safety verification for AI agents operating on the platform.

**Why This Matters for SingularityNET**:
The path to beneficial AGI requires robust safety mechanisms that don't depend on centralized gatekeepers. BiasGuard offers an alternative: safety verification that is:
- **Decentralized**: No single entity controls bias definitions
- **Transparent**: Open-source algorithms, auditable decisions
- **Community-governed**: Token holders vote on bias categories and thresholds
- **Interoperable**: Works with any AI agent on the network
