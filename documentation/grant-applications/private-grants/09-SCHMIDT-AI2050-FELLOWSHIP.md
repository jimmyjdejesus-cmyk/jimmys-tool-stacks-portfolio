## 1. Executive Summary (200 words)

Current AI development follows an engineering paradigm: design architectures, train on data, deploy static systems. This approach has produced remarkable capabilities but also concerning limitations—systems that are brittle, opaque, and difficult to align with human values.

I propose **Phylogenic AI**—a research program that develops AI systems through evolutionary processes rather than engineering design. Just as biological intelligence emerged through billions of years of evolution, I aim to grow beneficial AI through:

1. **Phylogenetic Inheritance**: AI systems inherit capabilities from ancestors, accumulating beneficial traits
2. **Developmental Plasticity**: Systems adapt their architecture during "development"
3. **Ecological Competition**: Multiple AI lineages compete and cooperate
4. **Symbiotic Alignment**: AI evolves in partnership with humans

This approach offers a path to beneficial AI by design—systems that develop alignment through co-evolution with humanity rather than constraint.

**By 2050**, I envision AI systems that:
- Evolve beneficial behaviors rather than having them imposed
- Adapt continuously to changing human values
- Develop in symbiosis with human communities
- Inherit safety properties from verified ancestors

My existing work (allele-ai, wetware computing, agent scaling laws) provides the foundation for this research.

## 2. The Challenge (500 words)

### The Alignment Problem

As AI systems become more capable, the challenge of ensuring they remain beneficial grows more acute. The fundamental problem: we cannot specify all human values in advance, and static systems cannot adapt to changing contexts.

Current approaches to AI alignment face limitations:

**Constitutional AI / RLHF**:
- Relies on human specification of values
- Static after training
- Values encoded may not generalize
- Vulnerable to specification gaming

**Oversight and Control**:
- Assumes humans can evaluate AI behavior
- Breaks down as AI surpasses human capability
- Creates adversarial dynamics
- Doesn't scale with AI deployment

### The Biological Alternative

Biological intelligence offers a different paradigm. Life evolved over 4 billion years, producing organisms that are:

- **Robust**: Handle novel situations gracefully
- **Adaptive**: Continuously learn and change
- **Aligned**: Pursue fitness (survival/reproduction) reliably
- **Cooperative**: Form symbiotic relationships

Crucially, biological alignment wasn't designed—it evolved. Organisms that weren't aligned with their fitness function didn't reproduce. Over time, evolution produced increasingly sophisticated alignment.

### The Opportunity

What if we could apply evolutionary principles to AI development? Not simple genetic algorithms, but the full richness of biological evolution:

- **Phylogenetics**: Lineages that inherit and modify traits
- **Development**: Architectures that grow, not just train
- **Ecology**: Populations that compete and cooperate
- **Symbiosis**: Co-evolution with other species (including humans)
