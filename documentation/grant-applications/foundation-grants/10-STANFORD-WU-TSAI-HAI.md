## 1. Project Abstract (300 words)

The disconnect between biological neural computation and artificial neural networks limits both our understanding of the brain and our ability to build truly intelligent systems.

We propose to bridge this gap through a systematic comparison of spiking neural networks (SNNs) with biological neural recordings. Our SpikingBrain platform implements biologically-plausible neural architectures that capture the temporal dynamics of biological neurons.

**Research Objectives**:
1. Validate SNN architectures against published neural response data from visual cortex (Allen Brain Atlas)
2. Implement spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for unsupervised learning in SNNs
3. Compare computational efficiency of biologically-plausible vs. standard approaches
4. Develop open-source tools for neuroscience-AI collaboration
