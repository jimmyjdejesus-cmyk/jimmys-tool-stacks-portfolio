## 1. Project Abstract (300 words)

The disconnect between biological neural computation and artificial neural networks limits both our understanding of the brain and our ability to build truly intelligent systems. While deep learning has achieved remarkable success, its architectures bear little resemblance to biological neural circuits—using continuous activations instead of spikes, static weights instead of plastic synapses, and feedforward processing instead of recurrent dynamics.

We propose to bridge this gap through a systematic comparison of spiking neural networks (SNNs) with biological neural recordings. Our SpikingBrain platform implements biologically-plausible neural architectures that capture the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, enabling direct comparison with neurophysiological data.

**Research Objectives**:
1. Validate SNN architectures against published neural response data from visual cortex (Allen Brain Atlas)
2. Implement spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for unsupervised learning in SNNs
3. Compare computational efficiency of biologically-plausible vs. standard approaches on perceptual tasks
4. Develop open-source tools for neuroscience-AI collaboration

**Technical Approach**:
Our SpikingBrain-7B-HAL platform provides a hardware abstraction layer that enables SNN execution on both conventional hardware and neuromorphic chips. We will extend this platform to:
- Integrate with neuroscience data repositories (Allen Brain Atlas, DANDI)
- Implement comparison metrics between SNN outputs and neural recordings
- Develop visualization tools for spike train analysis

**Broader Impact**:
This work will produce open-source tools that enable neuroscientists to validate computational models and AI researchers to incorporate biological insights. Our platform democratizes access to neuromorphic computing, enabling researchers without specialized hardware to explore biologically-inspired AI.

The intersection of AI and neuroscience promises breakthroughs in both fields. By grounding AI architectures in biological principles, we may discover more efficient, robust, and interpretable computing paradigms.
