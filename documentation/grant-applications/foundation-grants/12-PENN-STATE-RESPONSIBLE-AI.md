## 1. Project Abstract (250 words)

The rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in consequential domains—hiring, lending, healthcare, education—raises urgent questions about bias and fairness. While significant research exists on measuring AI bias, practitioners lack accessible tools to implement responsible AI principles in production systems.

We propose to develop and release **BiasGuard-Open**, an open-source toolkit for responsible AI deployment. Building on our existing BiasGuard platform (a 7-layer semantic pipeline for bias detection), we will create:

1. **Open-source detection library**: Python package for integrating bias detection into ML pipelines
2. **Practitioner guidelines**: Documentation translating research into actionable practices
3. **Educational materials**: Course modules for teaching responsible AI
4. **Benchmark datasets**: Curated evaluation sets for bias measurement

This project bridges the gap between responsible AI research and practice. Current tools are either proprietary (limiting transparency), research prototypes (not production-ready), or narrowly focused (single bias types). BiasGuard-Open provides a comprehensive, production-quality, transparent solution.

**Alignment with CSRAI Mission**: This project directly supports socially responsible AI by:
- Democratizing access to bias detection tools
- Enabling practitioners to implement responsible AI principles
- Providing educational resources for the next generation
- Contributing open-source infrastructure for the research community

**Deliverables**:
- Open-source Python package (pip installable)
- Practitioner guidelines document
- Course modules for responsible AI
- Annotated benchmark datasets
- Peer-reviewed publication
