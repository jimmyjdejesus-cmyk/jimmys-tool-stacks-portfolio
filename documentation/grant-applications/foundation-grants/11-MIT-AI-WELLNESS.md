## 1. Project Abstract (300 words)

Large Language Models are increasingly used in mental health contexts—therapy chatbots, crisis support, and wellness applications. However, these systems can generate harmful outputs: reinforcing negative self-talk, providing dangerous advice, or responding inappropriately to users in crisis. The mental health implications are severe, particularly for vulnerable populations.

We propose to develop and validate **BiasGuard-Wellness**, a specialized AI safety system that detects potentially harmful LLM outputs in mental health contexts. Building on our existing BiasGuard platform (7-layer semantic pipeline for bias detection), we will create domain-specific detection for:

1. **Crisis mishandling**: Inappropriate responses to users expressing suicidal ideation or self-harm
2. **Harmful advice**: Suggestions that could worsen mental health conditions
3. **Negative reinforcement**: Responses that validate or amplify negative self-perception
4. **Therapeutic boundary violations**: Responses that cross appropriate AI-human boundaries

**Technical Approach**:
We will fine-tune our existing MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings on mental health corpora, develop pattern libraries for harmful mental health content, and validate against expert-annotated datasets. The system will integrate with therapy chatbot platforms as a safety layer.

**Wellness Impact**:
- Protect vulnerable users from harmful AI outputs
- Enable safer deployment of AI in mental health applications
- Provide tools for mental health app developers to ensure safety
- Contribute to responsible AI development in healthcare

**Deliverables**:
1. BiasGuard-Wellness: Mental health-specific detection module
2. Annotated dataset of harmful vs. safe mental health AI outputs
3. Integration guidelines for therapy chatbot platforms
4. Peer-reviewed publication on findings

This work directly addresses the AI and wellness intersection by protecting mental health while enabling beneficial AI applications.
