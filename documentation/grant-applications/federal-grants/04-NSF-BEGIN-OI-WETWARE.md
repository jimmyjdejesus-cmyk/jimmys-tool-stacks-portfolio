## 2. Project Summary (1 page)

### Overview

The emerging field of organoid intelligence promises to revolutionize computing through biological substrates that combine the energy efficiency of neural tissue with the programmability of digital systems. However, organoid research requires specialized facilities, long development cycles, and raises ethical considerations—barriers that limit participation and slow progress.

We propose **Abeone**, an integrated software platform that enables organoid-inspired biological computing research through computational simulation. Abeone implements biologically plausible neural architectures—spiking neural networks, neuromorphic processing, and evolutionary optimization—that capture key properties of organoid computation without wet lab requirements.

### Intellectual Merit

This project advances organoid intelligence research through:

1. **Computational Organoid Models**: Software that simulates the information processing capabilities of biological neural organoids, enabling hypothesis testing before wet lab investment

2. **Neuromorphic Architecture Library**: Reusable components implementing spiking neurons, synaptic plasticity, and developmental processes observed in organoids

3. **Validation Framework**: Tools to compare computational models with real organoid recordings, enabling iterative refinement

4. **Evolutionary Development**: Algorithms that mimic biological development processes, growing neural architectures rather than designing them

### Broader Impacts

1. **Democratization**: Enables organoid research without specialized wet lab facilities
2. **Acceleration**: Computational screening before expensive biological experiments
3. **Ethics**: Reduces need for biological neural tissue in early research stages
4. **Education**: Training materials and platforms for interdisciplinary research
5. **Open Source**: All software publicly available for the research community
