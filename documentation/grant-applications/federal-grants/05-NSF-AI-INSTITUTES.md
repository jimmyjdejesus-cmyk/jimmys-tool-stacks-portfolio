## 📋 **Important Notes**

**This is NOT a direct application** - AI Institutes are led by universities.

**Your Role**: Industry partner providing:
- Technology and software platforms
- Real-world deployment expertise
- Commercialization pathway
- Matching funds or in-kind contributions

**Strategy**: Approach university PI with your capabilities as a potential industry partner.
