## 🔥 **The Pitch** (2 minutes)

### **Problem** (20 sec)
> "AI systems are being deployed everywhere, but there's no way to verify their outputs in real-time. ChatGPT hallucinates. Claude has biases. Enterprises are deploying these systems without any safety net."

### **Solution** (30 sec)
> "We built AI Guardians - a suite of real-time AI verification tools. Our flagship product, BiasGuard, uses a 7-layer semantic pipeline to detect bias, hallucinations, and harmful content before it reaches users."

### **Demo** (30 sec)
> Show: Chrome extension analyzing ChatGPT output, flagging bias in real-time

### **Technology** (20 sec)
> "We implemented Google DeepMind's agent scaling laws research and discovered critical insights about multi-agent system limits. Our 149-agent architecture is scientifically grounded, not 'vibe coded'."

### **Traction** (10 sec)
> "273+ repositories, production-ready Docker/Kubernetes, Chrome extension in beta, enterprise inquiries."

### **Ask** (10 sec)
> "We're raising $500K to validate our agent swarm against scaling laws, launch our enterprise beta, and hit 1,000 paying users."
