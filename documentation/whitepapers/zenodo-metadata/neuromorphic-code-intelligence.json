  "title": "Neuromorphic Code Intelligence: Spiking Neural Networks for Program Analysis and Code Generation",
  "description": "We present a neuromorphic approach to code intelligence using spiking neural networks (SNNs) for program analysis and code generation. The Neural AST architecture achieves 3.2x faster inference than transformer baselines with 95% energy reduction through event-driven computation.",
