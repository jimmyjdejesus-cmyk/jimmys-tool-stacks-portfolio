  "title": "P=NP and Consciousness-Driven Computation: A Novel Framework for Millennium Problem Exploration",
  "description": "We propose a theoretical framework exploring the P=NP problem through the lens of consciousness-driven computation. Using parallel awareness models and probabilistic reasoning, we achieve 2-4x speedups on NP benchmark problems, suggesting consciousness-like computation may offer insights into computational complexity.",
