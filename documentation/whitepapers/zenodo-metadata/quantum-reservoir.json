  "title": "Quantum Reservoir Dynamics: Exploring the Interface Between High-Dimensional Computing and Quantum Gravity",
  "description": "We propose that reservoir computing systems, characterized by high-dimensional chaotic dynamics and fading memory, may naturally interface with quantum vacuum fluctuations through mechanisms analogous to the Dynamical Casimir Effect. This connection suggests a novel pathway for exploring quantum gravity through computational rather than purely theoretical approaches.",
