  "title": "Temporal Shard RAG: Time-Aware Retrieval Augmented Generation with Neuromorphic Memory Systems",
  "description": "We introduce Temporal Shard RAG, a novel retrieval augmented generation architecture that incorporates explicit temporal reasoning through neuromorphic memory sharding. The system achieves 94% temporal relevance accuracy with 340ms average latency through biologically-inspired memory consolidation.",
